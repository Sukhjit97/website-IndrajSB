# CTEC3905 Assignment

This is very basic boilerplate code for you to get started with.

[w3schools, Responsive Topnav] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp) I have used this resource to help me understand and see how to develop a navigation bar that adjust itself in comparison to the screen size.

For the main layout I have used CSS grid with header, content and footer sections.

[06-lab-cssgrid](https://github.com/CTEC3905/06-lab-cssgrid)
I have added flex boxes within each page to insert images within a line as this helps to make the website look tidy and professional.

[js-local-storage-form](https://github.com/CTEC3905/js-local-storage-form)
I have created a local storage form on the contact.html page, that allows users to input their name into the system. This data is then locally stored in the browser.

[08-lab] (https://github.com/CTEC3905/08-lab)
I have created a CSS animation that displays a welcome banner moving across the screen when the homepage index.html is loaded.

[w3schools, Image Overlay Fade] (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_fade)
I have created a image hover overlay that displays text over the images when hovering over them. To help me do so, I used the tutorials provided by w3schools.

[07-lab-json-ajax] (https://github.com/CTEC3905/07-lab-json-ajax)
I have crated a wiki search facility within the games.html using JSON ajax and xmlh http requests. In order to do this, i used the lab work to create the wiki search facility.
