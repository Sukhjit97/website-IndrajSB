This is very basic boilerplate code for you to get started with.

To create a responsive nav bar that changes shape with the screen size, I have used W3Schools responsive Topnav guide to help me create and understand this. https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp. I have also changed a few elements and have adapted the code to my own work to show my own understanding.

For the main layout I have used CSS grid with header, content section and footer. Then when creating pages I will be inserting flex boxes into the content section.

On the homepage I have created a css animation that displays a welcome message. To help me do this I used w3schools guide https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_animation3.


I have created image hover overlay that displays text on top of the image. To do this I carried out research using https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_fade from w3schools.



I have crated a wiki search facility within the games.html page allowing users to find out more about games. I used lab 7 json-ajax to help me do this.
